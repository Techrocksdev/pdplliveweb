        <h3 class="title" translate>What is PDPL Act 2024</h3>
        <p class="sub_title" translate>
          Starting from August 11, 2023, companies gathering data on Indian
          citizens will be required to adhere to rigorous regulations aimed at
          safeguarding customer data. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act
          (PDPLA) is poised to establish a fresh benchmark for upholding
          consumer data rights. This change will urge companies to establish and
          implement the necessary systems and processes for compliance.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p class="sub_title" translate>
          Compliance will bring about certain challenges and set new security
          expectations for teams. The PDPLA adopts an expansive perspective on
          what qualifies as personal identification information. This means that
          companies must provide an equivalent level of protection for items
          such as an individual's IP address or cookie data, just as they do for
          more traditional personal details like name, address, and Aadhar/PAN
          number. For instance, the PDPLA takes a comprehensive approach to
          defining personal identification information, necessitating the same
          level of protection for details like an individual's IP address or
          cookie data as traditionally required for name, address, and
          Aadhar/PAN numbers.
        </p>
        <p class="sub_title" translate>
          However, The PDPLA leaves much to interpretation. It requires
          companies to provide a level of personal data protection that's
          considered "reasonable." However, it doesn't lay out a specific
          definition for what qualifies as "reasonable." This leaves the PDPL
          Act governing board with a fair amount of flexibility when assessing
          fines for data breaches and non-compliance.

          Benefits of an Effective Grievance Redressal Mechanism
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="sub_title" translate>
            <strong translate>Enhanced Consumer Confidence:</strong> A robust
            grievance redressal mechanism instils confidence among consumers
            regarding the protection of their personal data. It shows how
            dedicated the government is to protecting citizensâ€™ right to privacy
            and penalising those who violate it.
          </li>
          <li class="sub_title" translate>
            <strong translate>Deterrence Against Violations:</strong> The
            existence of a stringent grievance redressal mechanism serves as a
            deterrent against potential violations of the PDPL Act, 2023.
            Organizations are motivated to follow the guidelines for data
            security in order to stay out of trouble and safeguard their brand.
          </li>
          <li class="sub_title" translate>
            <strong translate>Promotion of Accountability:</strong> By providing
            a channel for individuals to voice their concerns and seek
            redressal, the grievance redressal mechanism promotes transparency
            and accountability in the digital ecosystem. It holds governmental
            and corporate organizations responsible for how they handle data.
